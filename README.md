# Fast linear response algorithm

A highly efficient algorithm for adjointly computing the linear response of chaotic systems, which is an extension of the conventional backpropagation methods to chaotic/unstable networks. This code accompanies the paper: "Fast adjoint differentiation of chaos", Angxiu Ni, https://arxiv.org/abs/TBD.

Do not worry about nan (not a number) warnings unless they appear in the results. I initialize all arrays with nan so that I do not accidentally use un-itended values.
