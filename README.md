# Fast adjoint response algorithm

A highly efficient algorithm for adjointly computing the linear response of chaotic systems, which is an extension of the conventional backpropagation methods to chaotic/unstable networks. This code accompanies the paper: "Fast adjoint differentiation of chaos", Angxiu Ni, https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07692.

To change different dynamical systems, just paste the ds.py and plot.py files from /dss/ to overwrite those in the current folder.
